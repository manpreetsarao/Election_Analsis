## Overview of Election Audit:
In this project we assisted a Colorado election board employee Tom to calculate the vote results. We calculate the Total number of votes, number of votes for each candidate and percentage of votes for each candidate. We used these calculations to obtain the Winner of election.
Earlier, this task was done by using excel. Tomâ€™s Manager wants to automate this task, we used python for automation.
We have raw data which has three columns, first is Ballot Id, second is county and third is candidate. From this dataset we obtained election results.

## Election-Audit Summary:
The script can be modified to include inputs to run only desired scripts like just to check to the winner. By adding more data script can be used to calculate election results statewide or nationwide. To do this we need to add more columns like state names, Election Type, Party name etc.
